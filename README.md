# Cluster API Visualizer (CAPI V8r)

Cluster API developers and operators often need to quickly get insight multicluster configuration. This app provides that insight by making Cluster API significantly more accessible and easier to understand for both new and experienced users. It gives a birdâ€™s eye view of a multicluster architecture, visualizes all the Cluster API custom resources for each cluster, and provides quick access to the specs and status of any resource.

### Quick start for local deployment 

## 1. Prerequisites

Install and set up [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/), and [helm](https://helm.sh/). In addition, install any additional prerequisites needed for [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
#### 2. Create a Cluster API management cluster

Create a local management cluster with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and a workload cluster by following the [Cluster API quick start guide](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html).

##### 3. To deploy to a local kind cluster 
```
make build-and-deploy
```
